# GAME-Stone-paper-scissor
This project is a simple Python-based Stone–Paper–Scissors game where a user plays against the computer. The computer makes a random choice, and the winner is decided using basic game rules. The project demonstrates the use of conditional statements, loops, user input, and the random module in Python.
